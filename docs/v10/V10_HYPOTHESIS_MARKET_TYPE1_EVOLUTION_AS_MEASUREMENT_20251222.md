# V10 Note: Market Type-1 Hypothesis & Evolution-as-Measurement / 市场第一类假设与“演化作为测量” — 2025-12-22

## 1) Hypothesis (not a goal) / 假设（不是目标）

**Hypothesis**: Financial markets (stocks/futures/crypto) behave like a “Type-1 Gödel-like system”:  
at any moment there exist one or a few **dominant effective dimensions**, but the dominant set can **switch over time** (regime switching).

中文（辅助）：市场不是“纯混沌”，而是任意时刻总有少数主导维度在起作用，只是主导维度会换主角。

> Important: This is a **working assumption**. We do not treat “true/false” as the primary output of V10.

## 2) Why evolution is used / 为什么用演化

We are not using evolution to “discover a strategy”.  
We use evolution as a **measurement instrument**:

- If the market has dominant dimensions that can be exploited, an adaptive population should show **non-random, repeatable structure** under strict controls.
- If not, outcomes should look unstable, non-repeatable, or explainable only by hidden designer gates.

中文（辅助）：演化是“尺子”，不是“策略工厂”。

## 3) What we observe / 我们观察什么

We record evidence in two worlds:

- **B-stage (offline research world)**: controlled A/B2 + ablations + attribution audits.
- **C-stage (execution interface world)**: real friction/positions evidence chain + long-run stability.

Key observation targets (high level):

- **Time-structure signal**: A (real time order) should outperform B2 (destroy time order) on primary endpoints.
- **Dominant-dimension episodes**: under stress, effective dimensionality may drop (e.g., “market mode” strengthens), and we should see consistent signatures in E/M/C evidence.
- **Principle 4 compliance**: selection pressure should be ecological (world rules), not man-made strategy fences.

## 4) What would count as supporting evidence (engineering sense) / 什么算“支持”（工程意义）

Supporting evidence does not mean “proving truth”. It means increasing credibility:

- Results are **replicable across seeds** and **consistent across windows** (where expected).
- Mechanism claims survive **ablation** and **attribution audits** (v2/v3).
- Fence audit shows no “strategy fences” shaping behavior silently (inventory + telemetry + counterfactual).

---

## 5) Non-goals / 非目标

- Not claiming a final ontology of markets.
- Not treating “market is Type-1” as a deliverable requirement.
- Not optimizing for profit in the C-stage; the C-stage is about auditability and survivability.
