# V13 Kickoff — Quant Delivery Archive (v0) — 2026-01-10

This directory archives the Quant-side kickoff delivery reports provided via `/tmp/` so they remain auditable and linkable.

## Archived reports

- `V13_KICKOFF_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- `V13_VPS_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `V13_FINAL_SUMMARY.md`

## Key fact (frozen for V13 Phase 1)

- Local environment cannot use WebSocket; therefore **live capture must run on VPS**.
