## 🎯 Two Core Beliefs

Before diving into what Prometheus is, let us share two fundamental beliefs that shape everything we do.

---

### I. The Greatest Risk in Designing a Perfect System is "Design" Itself

> **"Imperfection comes from the act of designing"**

When we set out to build a trading system, we naturally try to:
- Design perfect strategies
- Design optimal parameters
- Design robust risk controls

But we learned a profound truth through painful experience:

**Every designed "perfection" is inherently dead.**

Like the Architect in *The Matrix*, who designed a perfect world and failed. Then redesigned it with "choice" and "imperfection" and still failed. Five times.

Why?

**Not because the design wasn't good enough. But because the act of "designing" itself is the problem.**

```
Designed perfection     = Static, dead
Designed imperfection   = Still static, still dead
```

**True intelligence cannot be designed. It must emerge.**

### II. Death is the Greatest Gift to Life

> **"Without death, there is no evolution"**

This is not poetry. This is engineering truth.

If agents never die:
- Bad strategies never get eliminated
- Good strategies never get rewarded
- Population never evolves
- Intelligence never emerges

**Death is not the enemy. Immortality is.**

#### Three Levels of Death

In Prometheus, we embrace death at three levels:

```
1. Agent Death
   Poor performers eliminated → Population evolves → Better strategies emerge

2. Population Death
   Mass extinction events → System restarts with new genes → Avoid local optima

3. System Death
   Complete system crash → Lessons extracted → Wisdom inherited by next version
```

Every crash is not a failure. **Every crash is a lesson.**  
Every death is not the end. **Every death is a gift to the next generation.**

**Death is the engine of evolution. Evolution is the source of intelligence.**

---

## 🌟 What is Prometheus?

Based on these two core beliefs, we created Prometheus.

**Prometheus is not a trading system.**

### Prometheus is

- 🧬 **A Living Organism** — Can grow, learn, and evolve
- 💻 **An Operating System** — Manages resources and schedules tasks
- 🏭 **An Evolution Factory** — Produces, tests, eliminates, optimizes
- 🌍 **A World Model** — Understands markets and builds patterns
- 🔬 **A Research Framework** — Verifies hypotheses and observes phenomena
- ✨ **An Emergence Engine** — Where intelligence arises naturally

---

## 🎯 Core Architecture

### The Evolution Cycle

```
1. BIRTH
   ↓
   New agents born with random genes
   
2. LIFE
   ↓
   Trade, profit or loss, adapt to market
   
3. DEATH
   ↓
   Poor performers eliminated by natural selection
   
4. REBIRTH
   ↓
   Successful genes inherited, mutated, combined
   
5. EMERGENCE
   ↓
   Intelligence arises from this cycle
   
   ↻ Repeat forever
```

### Key Components

- **Prophet** — The observer, not the controller. Records what works, doesn't dictate what should work.
- **Moirai** — The fate sisters. Manage birth, life, and death of agents.
- **Agents** — Autonomous traders. Each with unique genetic code.
- **World Signature** — The market's "mood". Changes drive different strategies.
- **Experience DB** — The system's memory. Learns from every death.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Read the Philosophy First

Start with **[THE_GOD_CODE.md](docs/philosophy/THE_GOD_CODE.md)**.

It's not a technical document.  
It's an 8-hour philosophical journey.  
It explains **why** we do what we do.

### 2. Understand the Architecture

Then read the [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) to understand **how** the system works.

### 3. Explore the Journey

Check out [Development Journey](docs/journey/v1_to_v7.md) to see **what** we've built and learned.

### 4. See Examples

Look at [Examples](examples/) for simplified demonstrations of key concepts.

## 🧪 Development Status

### Theory & Practice

This repository (**Prometheus-Research**) shares our research and philosophy.

In parallel, we're actively developing **Prometheus v7.0** in a private project, testing these ideas in real cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin 7×24 trading).

### Our Journey So Far

```
v1.0 - v3.0 (2024 Q1-Q2)
  ✓ Initial explorations, simple agent systems
  ✓ Lost ~30% capital
  ✓ Learned: Pre-designed strategies don't work in crypto
  ✓ Realized: Need evolution, not design
  
v4.0 - v5.0 (2024 Q3)
  ✓ Introduced evolution mechanisms
  ✓ Mixed results, unstable performance
  ✓ Learned: Evolution needs proper selection pressure
  ✓ Realized: Still too much human interference

v6.0 (2024 Q4)
  ✓ Complete rebuild with evolution at core
  ✓ Stable but limited profitability
  ✓ Learned: Still too much "design" in the system
  ✓ Realized: Need to let go of control
  
v7.0 (2025 Q1 - Current)
  ✓ Multi-Niche Architecture breakthrough
  ✓ Prophet as observer, not controller
  ✓ Embracing emergence over design
  → Current phase: Zero-Knowledge Training
  
  ⚠️ Critical Reflection:
  We realize that "Multi-Niche Architecture" itself is still "design".
  We designed 10 ecological niches, designed capital allocation,
  designed diversity constraints. This may contradict our philosophy:
  "Imperfection comes from the act of designing."
  
  We're questioning whether this framework is necessary, or if
  diversity can emerge naturally without pre-designed niches.
  This may be abolished in v8.0 based on experimental results.
  
  This is the beauty of research: constantly questioning ourselves.
```

### 🧪 Current Experiment: Zero-Knowledge Training

**The Ultimate Test**: Can agents learn to profit with **ZERO pre-designed trading strategies**?

#### What We Give Them

```python
✅ Raw market data
   - Price (OHLCV)
   - Volume
   - Time

✅ Action space
   - Buy
   - Sell
   - Hold

✅ Feedback
   - Profit
   - Loss
```

#### What We DON'T Give Them

```python
❌ No technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
❌ No trading rules (buy low sell high, etc.)
❌ No strategy templates (trend following, mean reversion, etc.)
❌ No domain knowledge (support/resistance, patterns, etc.)
❌ No pre-training (no historical successful strategies)
```

#### The Core Hypothesis

**If agents can learn to profit from pure evolution:**
- It proves intelligence can truly emerge
- It proves design is not necessary
- It proves evolution is sufficient
- It validates our entire philosophy

**This is not just a trading system experiment.**  
**This is a test of emergence itself.**

## 🌙 Final Words

### Our Choice

Based on these two core beliefs, we make our choice:

```
Traditional Approach:        Our Choice:

Avoid risk                   Accept risk
→ Build perfect defenses     → It's the price of evolution

Control everything           Let go of control
→ Leave nothing to chance    → Create conditions, not outcomes

Prevent failure              Welcome failure
→ Never let system crash     → It's how we learn

Seek permanent solutions     Embrace continuous evolution
→ Find the perfect answer    → There is no final answer
```

As the Architect's final realization in *The Matrix*:

> *"Will the system crash again?"*  
> *"For as long as it lasts."*  
> *"And what does it matter?"*

From **preventing collapse** to **accepting collapse**  
From **pursuing eternity** to **cherishing the moment**  
From **perfectionism** to **continuous evolution**  
From **control** to **letting go**

---

**We choose:**
- Not to design intelligence, but to create conditions for intelligence to emerge
- Not to control evolution, but to observe and learn from it
- Not to fear death, but to see it as our greatest teacher

**This is not resignation. This is liberation.**

---

From death, we learn.  
From collapse, we evolve.  
From emergence, intelligence arises.

**Not from design, but from freedom.**  
**Not from control, but from choice.**  
**Not from planning, but from evolution.**

**This is THE WAY.**

### Tools & Collaboration

This project was developed through an intensive year-long collaboration between human insight and AI assistance:

- **[Cursor Editor](https://cursor.sh/)** - AI-powered development environment
- **[Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/)** - For rapid prototyping, iteration, and philosophical discussions

### The Emergence of Understanding

What started as a simple trading system became a profound exploration of emergence, design, and intelligence. The development process itself embodies Prometheus's core philosophy:

**Human contribution:**
- Vision and direction
- Philosophical insights  
- Critical questioning
- Pattern recognition

**AI contribution:**
- Rapid implementation
- Documentation
- Code iteration
- Thought recording

**Emergent result:**
- 7 major versions in 1 year
- Deep philosophical realizations
- A complete thought experiment
- This documentation

The human-AI collaboration demonstrated the very principle we're studying: **intelligence emerging from interaction, not imposed by design.**
