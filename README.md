## 🎯 Research Question

**Can the unpredictability of markets be measured?**

---

## 💡 Hypothesis

Markets may be a **Gödelian system**: no complete, self-provable prediction framework can exist from within the system itself.

If this is true:
- We cannot find a "perfect" prediction model
- But can we measure the **boundary** of predictability?
- Can we observe the **structure** of unpredictability?

---

## 🔬 Research Framework

In order to test whether markets are a **Gödelian system** (where no complete, self-provable prediction framework exists), we construct a multi-agent system with:

**Three Core Constraints:**
1. **No prior strategy** - agents start with random weights, no human-designed logic
2. **No objective function** - no explicit "goal" to optimize
3. **No explicit optimization** - only natural selection through survival

Through **minimal, local, life-and-death trading rules**, we observe whether **stable, reproducible, comparable statistical structures** emerge spontaneously.

**Thus verifying: whether the unpredictability of markets is itself measurable.**

---

To achieve this goal, we developed a methodology to design a measurement system. The main principles are:

### Principle 0: Measurability Criteria

Before applying this method, determine if the target system is measurable:

**0.1 Disturbance is Measurable**
- The observation system's interference with the target system is quantifiable or comparable

**0.2 Emergent Patterns**
- Observation results exhibit spontaneously emergent patterns
- Not validation of presets, but discovery of the unexpected

### Six Core Principles

**Principle 1**: Gene dimensions align with observable features (M = N)

**Principle 2**: Allow redundant dimensions (evolution will reduce)

**Principle 3**: Features = measurable + measurement bias (evolution discovers truth)

**Principle 4**: Evolution follows natural selection (objective world as sole judge)

**Principle 5**: System evolves, observer recognizes patterns

**Principle 6**: Better solutions always exist (continuous exploration)

**→ [Complete Framework](docs/v8/V8.md)**

---

### Minimal Implementation

- **Features**: 31 aligned dimensions (market) + 0-32 mystery dimensions (unknown)
- **Decision**: Linear weighting → trading signal
- **Birth/Death**: Occur randomly

---

## 🧪 Current Status

**Experiments in progress.**

System design has been refined through multiple iterations:
- Fixed critical bugs in capital management
- Improved reproduction mechanism (mystery dimensions regenerate each generation)
- Implementing system-level survival pressure

**No results to report yet.** Waiting for reliable data before drawing conclusions.

## 📖 Documentation

### Framework
- **[V8.0 Principles](docs/v8/V8.md)** - Principle 0 + 6 core principles (Chinese)
- **[Methodology](docs/v8/METHODOLOGY_EN.md)** - Technical details (English)
- **[方法论](docs/v8/METHODOLOGY.md)** - 技术细节（中文）

### Reports
Experimental reports will be added as reliable data becomes available.

## 🤔 Why This Matters

**Traditional approach:**
- Design a strategy → test it → optimize it
- Question: "Can I predict the market?"

**This approach:**
- Minimal rules → let evolution explore → observe what emerges
- Question: "Is the market fundamentally predictable?"

**If stable structures emerge:**
- Markets may have measurable patterns (within certain boundaries)

**If no stable structures emerge:**
- Markets may be fundamentally unpredictable (supporting Gödelian hypothesis)

**Either way, we learn something fundamental about market complexity.**

## 🔄 Replication

The mechanism is extremely simple.

Code is not open-sourced because:
1. The mechanism is very simple
2. The code is terrible (blame Cursor)

**If you replicate, please share your findings.**

## 💬 Note

This is an early-stage research project. Conclusions are not yet established.

I'm observing, recording, and waiting for data to speak.
